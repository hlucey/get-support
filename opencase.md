# Working with support cases 
{: #open-case}

If you experience problems with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}, you can use support cases to get help with technical, account and access, billing and invoice or sales inquiry issues. You can create and manage a support case by using the [Support Center](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon"). After you submit a support case, the support team works to investigate and resolve the issue depending on your type of support plan.

By default, users in an account don't have access to create, update, search, or view cases. As the account owner, you must provide users access by assigning an Identity and Access Management (IAM) access policy. For more information, see [Assigning user access for working with support cases](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-access#access)

## Creating support cases
{: #opentechcase}

All users can open any type of support case.

By default, users in an account don't have access to create, update, search, or view cases. You must provide users access by assigning an Identity and Access Management (IAM) access policy. For more information, see [Platform management roles](/docs/iam?topic=iam-userroles#platformroles)

  3. Select **Technical**, **Account & Access**, **Billing & Invoice**, or **Sales Inquiry** depending on your issue.

  5. Select the category and offering of your case. The information that is required depends on the resource context that you selected and also on the type of support plan of your account.
  6. Complete the required information for the subject and description of the case. 
  
    You can attach files that can provide more details about the issue you're experiencing.

## Managing your support cases 
{: #check-case-status}

All client support issues are documented in support cases. Each support case is assigned a unique case number for reference and a severity level based on the details in the case description. You can use the case number to review your support case progress and update the support case. Updates to your cases and responses are sent to you by email and recorded in the case notes. 

To view and manage your support cases, use the following steps:

  1. Click **Support** from the console menu bar.
  2. To view a listing of open cases, select **Manage cases**.
  3. Select a case from the list to add comments or update a case.
  4. Closed or resolved cases can be found by using the filter option to retrieve cases in any status. 

If you're a classic infrastructure user, and you don't see a listing of a previous case, go to **View archived cases**.
